# *Pizza Sales Analysis with Power BI*

### Introduction:
This project is my first step in learning Power BI and applying it to solve a real-world problem. The goal is to analyze pizza sales data using various tables and columns to gain insights into sales patterns and customer behavior.

The project uses the following tables and their respective columns:

- Orders
   - order_id
   - time
   -  date

- Order Details
    - order_details_id
    - order_id
    - pizza_id
    - quantity

- Pizzas
   - pizza_id
   - pizza_type_id
   - size
   - price

- Pizza Types
  - pizza_type_id
  - name
  - category
  - ingredients

Using the above tables, the following insights have been generated:

- **Total Sales**: The total revenue generated by pizza sales.

- **Highest Pizza Sold:** Identification of the most frequently sold pizza.

- **Pizza Categories:** Analysis of the best-selling pizza categories (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian, etc.).

- **Repeat vs. First-Time Customers:** Classification of customers based on their purchase history.

### Tools and Skills
